# EMACSeract

**EMACSeract** is a VS Code extension that reintroduces essential Emacs-style editing commandsâ€”one thoughtful, high-speed keystroke at a time. If you've ever reached for `M-z` or `M-SPC` and been met with despair, this extension is for you.

### ðŸ”¤ Zap to Char (`Alt+Z`)

Delete everything from the cursor up to and including the next occurrence of a character.
Fast, intuitive, and extremely satisfyingâ€”just like in Emacs.

Collapse multiple spaces or tabs around the cursor into a single space.
Perfect for cleaning up messy, misaligned text.
